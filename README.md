# GraphQL-Crud-App
A simple GraphQL Crud Application, using express server, axios library for fetching and json-server for creating out own server.

You can use this in your projects. 

Just clone this repo and open cmd in your project directory.

After opening just type 'npm install' for installing dependencies.

After installing, run your app by typing 'npm run dev:server' and open http://localhost:4040/.

It is important for you to run json-server as well, for manipulating the json data which will host on local server i.e 
http://localhost:3000/.

for running json server, type 'json-server --watch data.json'

All your manipulated data will store in 'data.json'
